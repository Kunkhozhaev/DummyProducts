Stack:
- Retrofit2
- Dagger2
- Glide
- Flow
- Coroutines
- Jetpack Navigation
- XML
- Kotlin
  
2 screens are implemented:
  - All products
  - Single product page

Also:
- Used paging library for pagination
- Used Kirill Rozov's binding library for QOL
- Different layouts for light and dark themes
- No orientation change is handled. The reason: e-commerce apps like KazanExpress, Lamoda, Wilderries, OZON and Я.Маркет don't have this feature either
